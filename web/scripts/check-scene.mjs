/** The two invariants the interface rests on, checked without a browser.
 *
 *  1. Evidence to shot mapping. The reel can hold fewer shots than the answer holds evidence,
 *     because a moment whose source yields no usable clip is dropped. Everything the viewer
 *     clicks is an evidence item, so a single dropped moment used to shift every citation,
 *     needle, beacon and camera move after it by one, with no error anywhere. `lib/reel.ts`
 *     is the only place that mapping lives.
 *
 *  2. Placement. Every marker has to sit on the world its own evidence names, clear of its
 *     neighbours, with the camera framing the moment. A camera that flies to the right
 *     coordinates on the wrong world is the same lie as the wrong clip.
 *
 *  Checked against the saved answers in `public/answers`, which are real pipeline output.
 *
 *  Run with:  npm test    (from web/)
