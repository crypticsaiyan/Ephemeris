/** Scene layout. Not to scale and deliberately so: Mars at true distance from Earth is a

/* The planets sit on one arc heading away from the Sun, ordered by true heliocentric distance:
 * Mercury nearest, Saturn farthest, every body in between where it belongs. The earlier layout
 * ran that arc backwards, putting Mercury farthest from the Sun and Jupiter nearest, which is
 * the one thing an orrery cannot get wrong.
 *
 * Distance from the Sun is `55 + 65*sqrt(au)`, not the AU itself. Linear AU is unusable here:
 * Saturn is 24x Mercury's orbit, so a frame holding Saturn buries the inner four inside the
 * Sun's own glow. The square root compresses the outer system while keeping every gap positive,
 * so the ordering survives the squeeze. Resulting scene distance from the Sun:
 *
 *     Mercury  0.39 AU ->  95      Mars     1.52 AU -> 135
 *     Venus    0.72 AU -> 110      Jupiter  5.20 AU -> 202
 *     Earth    1.00 AU -> 119      Saturn   9.58 AU -> 255
 *
 * The arc also fans sideways as it goes out, because distance alone does not separate them:
 * Earth and Mars are close enough in compressed distance that on a single sightline their
 * marker discs would overlap. Sizes stay ranked correctly (Jupiter largest, Mercury smallest)
 * but compressed too: true relative size would make Mercury invisible next to Jupiter.
 *
 * The band is centred near the origin so the single `directionalLight`, which aims from the Sun
 * at the origin, still lands square on the bodies rather than raking across them. */
