"""Video-level era extraction.

The first quality gate found scene-level era extraction produced a usable year for
only 9 of 58 scenes. That was the model behaving correctly: a 10-second scene
usually states no year, and it was told not to guess.

But the *clip* often does. "For decades, planetary scientists have suspected" and
"the 1965 flyby returned the first close-up images" are statements about the whole
video, invisible to any single scene. So a second pass reads the joined transcript
plus NASA's own catalogue description and returns the mission timeline the clip
covers.

This runs on `coll.generate_text()`, so the reasoning stays inside VideoDB rather
than adding a second model provider to the project.

Three-tier fallback for a scene's date, most trustworthy first:

  1. scene-level extraction, when the model gave a plausible year AND said where it
     came from (spoken words or on-screen text)
  2. video-level extraction from this module, when the clip as a whole is anchored
     to an era
  3. NASA's publication year, which is always correct and often uninteresting

`era_axis` on every record says which tier was used, so a chronology built on
inferred dates is never presented as though it came from metadata.

Read the catalogue description and the transcript, then report the mission history

Rules:
- Report a mission only if the video names it or unmistakably depicts it.
- Give each mission the year of the events the video discusses, not the year the
  video was made.
- earliest_era_year is the earliest year of any event, mission, or finding the video
  discusses. If the video discusses no datable event, use 0.
- primary_topic_year is the year of the main subject of the video.
- Never guess. An empty list and 0 are correct answers when the material is silent.
